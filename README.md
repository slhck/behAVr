Audiovisual quality and behavior measurement tool for subjective tests, written in Ruby on Rails.

:warning: This tool uses a modified version of the [Clappr player](https://github.com/clappr/clappr). It works with Flash only, since that was the technology chosen at the time of developing this tool.

## Requirements

* Ruby 2.7.5 (not tested with 3.x) via rbenv
* PostgreSQL 9.5.0 or above, or MySQL
* Google Chrome v46 or something older (to make Flash work reliably)

## Setup

### Creating Videos

Videos have to be placed in `public/videos/<srdId>`, where `<srcId>` is some alphanumeric key identifying the video uniquely. In that folder, there must be one file called `<srcId>.m3u8` â€“ the HLS playlist.

To create videos, use ffmpeg's HLS segmenter. For example:

```bash
cat <<EOF > src01.m3u8
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1,BANDWIDTH=500000,RESOLUTION=480x270
ts/480x270.m3u8
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1,BANDWIDTH=1000000,RESOLUTION=640x360
ts/640x360.m3u8
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1,BANDWIDTH=2000000,RESOLUTION=1280x720
ts/1280x720.m3u8
EOF

mkdir ts
ffmpeg -y -i input.mp4 -c:a aac -strict experimental -ac 2 -b:a 64k -ar 44100 -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p -x264opts keyint=12:min-keyint=12:scenecut=-1 -profile:v baseline -level 21 -b:v 100K -r 12 -g 36 -f hls -hls_time 1 -hls_list_size 0 -s 480x270 ts/480x270.m3u8

```

Thumbnails have to be put in `thumbnails`, a subfolder of each video folder. Thumbnails, e.g. every 10 seconds, can be generated with:

```bash
ffmpeg -i /path/to/input.mp4 -vf fps=1/10 thumbnails/%04d.png
```

### Database Setup

Depending on the database adapter used, change your settings in `config/database.yml`.

### PostgreSQL

After installing PostgreSQL, add a user with database creation rights:

```sql
create role behavr with createdb login password 'behavr';
```

Change the details as necessary in the command and in the `conig/database.yml` file.

#### MySQL

Run the following after installing MySQL from a root commandline:

```sql
CREATE USER 'behavr'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'behavr';
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS behavr_development;
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS behavr_production;
GRANT ALL ON behavr_development.* TO 'behavr'@'localhost';
GRANT ALL ON behavr_production.* TO 'behavr'@'localhost';
```

### Configuring

- To add experiments, modify the `config/experiments.yml` file.
- Add videos in the `config/videos.yml` file.
- Add conditions in the `config/conditions.yml` file.
- To add users, modify the `config/users.yml` file.

Some notes:

- With the `manual` condition assignment, you have to specify the test sequences manually. With `random`, every user will get a different set of test sequences assigned, by taking one HRC after the other and randomly assigning it to a SRC. In the latter case, you can specify a `reference_condition` that should be shown for all sequences.
- Each user will be assigned to each experiment automatically.

Then, when you run `rake db:seed`, the data from these files will be imported.

## Running

To start in dev mode:

- Install Ruby
- Install Bundler with `gem install bundler`
- Run `bundle install` in this folder
- Run the migrations with `rake db:migrate`
- Run the seeds with `rake db:seed`
- Run the server with `foreman start`
- Browse to `localhost:5000`

Log in with the email of the test users, as specified in the `users.yml` file.

If you are test user and you have been assigned experiments, you can join and run the experiments.

If you are an admin, you can navigate to `http://localhost:5001/admin/index` to see an overview of the results.

## Exporting Results

This creates CSV export files. Run:

```
bundle exec rake behavr:export_data 
```
